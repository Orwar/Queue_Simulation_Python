# Simulation-of-a-single-server-queue
Discrete Event simulation of a single server queue using Python. 
## Why Study Queues?
**Waiting for to be attended is part of daily life. We wait in restaurants, we do a
line to board a plane, and we stand in line to be served at
official dependencies. The phenomenon of waiting is not limited to human beings:
jobs wait to be processed, planes fly in circles at different heights
until they are allowed to land, and the cars stop at traffic lights. Deleting the
waiting entirely is not a feasible option because the cost of installation and
operation of the operation center can be prohibitive. Our only recourse is to search
the balance between the cost of offering a service and the cost of waiting for it to be served.
Queue analysis is the vehicle to achieve this goal.** *(Taha,H.)* .
