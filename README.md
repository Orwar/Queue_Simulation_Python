## Why Study Queues?
**Waiting to be attended is part of daily life. We wait in restaurants, we do a
line to board a plane, and we stand in line to be served at
official dependencies. The phenomenon of waiting is not limited to human beings:
jobs wait to be processed, planes fly in circles at different heights
until they are allowed to land, and the cars stop at traffic lights. Deleting the
waiting entirely is not a feasible option because the cost of installation and
operation of the operation center can be prohibitive. Our only recourse is to search
the balance between the cost of offering a service and the cost of waiting for it to be served.
Queue analysis is the vehicle to achieve this goal.** *(Taha,H.)* 
##  Objective: 
- ***Generate a Simulation model that outputs the performance measures, such as average length, average waiting time, utilization of the system, etc. to provide information for designing or improving service facilities.***

## Necessary data
- λ: the arrival rate (the expected time between each customer arriving, e.g. 1 minute)
- μ: the service rate (the expected service time, e.g. 1.5 minutes)
- the distribution of the data
- c: the number of servers
- The number of customers to be simulated
